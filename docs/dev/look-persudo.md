# Viewing Game Code

This tutorial will guide you through the game code flow.

:::info

**Dead Cells** is written in **Haxe** and runs on the **HashLink Virtual Machine**, not the **CoreCLR**.

:::

:::tip

Before starting, it's recommended to read the [wiki](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hashlink/wiki) for basic information about the **HashLink Virtual Machine**.

:::

## Using crashlink

See the [crashlink documentation](https://n3rdl0rd.github.io/crashlink/).

## Using hlbc-gui

See the [README](https://github.com/Gui-Yom/hlbc).

## Using GamePseudocode

:::warning

- **GamePseudocode** is derived from **HashLink Bytecode** of **Dead Cells**. It is intended solely for viewing game code flow.
- For readability of decompiled results, **GamePseudocode** does not maintain a one-to-one correspondence with **HashLink Bytecode**.
- **GamePseudocode** outputs may be erroneous; use in conjunction with [crashlink](#using-crashlink) or [hlbc](#using-hlbc-gui).

:::

### Modify Configuration File

:::tip

Configuration file location: `coremod/config/modcore.json`

This file is automatically generated upon initial startup.

:::

- Open the configuration file and locate `GeneratePseudocodeAssembly`. Change its value to `true`.
- Save the configuration file.

### Launch Game

- Launch the game. It will automatically generate **GamePseudocode**. Please wait patiently.
- After reaching the main menu, close the game.

### Open GamePseudocode

- Navigate to the directory `coremod/cache`. You should find the `GamePseudocode.dll` file.
  - If it's missing, verify your steps.
- Open `GamePseudocode.dll` using your preferred **.NET decompiler**.
  - We recommend using [DnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy).
